destructuring assignment: It’s called destructuring assignment, because it “destructurizes” by copying items into variables. But the array itself is not modified.]
                          it can be explained by the folloeing example:

                          let arr=["hello","hello again"];

                          let [first,second]=arr;    {here destructuring assignment is used where we assign some value directly to the arr}
                          console.log(first);
                          console.log(second);
