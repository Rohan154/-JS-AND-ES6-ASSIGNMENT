question 4: what are template and string literals?

answers: string literals were generally used in es5 where for concatenating any words or space we have to use much single quotes or double quotes.
         and strings also become complicated .example:

         const string='this is\n my \"javascript\" code';
         console.log(string);


         so to remove this complicasy in es6 we got new features introduced named `template literals` where  only using `` symbol we can use space or \n or writing will become very easy and understandable.
         example: const name='rohan';              
                 const message=`
                 Hi, ${name} ,

                 Thankyou for mailing us ${2*2}th time

                 Regards,
                 rohan`

                console.log(message);


here,in the above example we have only used `` inside that whatever we write will be written like that only . 

so, the benefits of template literals is that in email sending from the side of developer.
